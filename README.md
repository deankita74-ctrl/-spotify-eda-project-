 Exploratory Data Analysis on Spotify dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## ðŸŽµ Spotify EDA Project

###  Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Spotify track data to uncover trends and insights related to song characteristics such as popularity, energy, danceability, loudness, tempo, and more.

The analysis helps understand what makes a track popular and provides visual summaries of patterns across different attributes.



###  Objectives

* Analyze the relationship between track features and popularity.
* Visualize distributions of various audio features.
* Explore correlations among attributes like tempo, loudness, and energy.
* Identify patterns or trends across different genres or artists.



###  Dataset

The dataset used contains Spotify track information including:

* `track_name`
* `artist_name`
* `popularity`
* `danceability`
* `energy`
* `loudness`
* `tempo`
* `valence`
* `duration_ms`
* `speechiness`, `acousticness`, etc.



###  Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python 3**
* **Pandas** â€“ Data cleaning & manipulation
* **NumPy** â€“ Numerical operations
* **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization
* **Plotly** â€“ Interactive charts
* **Colab / Jupyter Notebook** â€“ Execution environment



###  Key Insights

* Highly popular songs tend to have **moderate energy and danceability levels**.
* Thereâ€™s a **positive correlation** between **energy** and **loudness**.
* Some genres show unique characteristics in **valence** and **tempo** patterns.
* Interactive visualizations help compare artist performances across multiple attributes.



###  How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deankita74-ctrl/spotify-eda-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd spotify-eda-project
   ```
3. Open the notebook:

   * Option 1: In **Google Colab** â†’ upload `spotify.project.ipynb`
   * Option 2: In **VS Code / Jupyter Notebook**

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook spotify.project.ipynb
     ```
4. Run all cells to reproduce analysis and visualizations.



###  Example Visualizations

* Distribution of song popularity
* Correlation heatmap between audio features
* Energy vs. Loudness scatter plot
* Danceability trends across genres



###  Conclusion

This EDA provides a comprehensive view of Spotifyâ€™s song dataset and reveals interesting relationships between audio features and popularity. It can serve as a foundation for future work like **machine learning prediction of song success** or **recommendation systems**.

Would you like me to make the README more **aesthetic (with emojis, badges, and color styling)** or keep it **clean and minimal for academic submission**?
